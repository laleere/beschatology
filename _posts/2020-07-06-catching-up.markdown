It's been a while! When my local lockdown hit and I was suddenly unable to go to my job (from which I was quickly terminated anyways) or use the library (which remains closed), I found myself unable to do much more than keep up with my classes while working to replace the fragile apparatus of productivity rituals around which my routine had hung. I've since returned to something like normalcy, but in the meantime I allowed a rather imposing backlog of unaddressed books to accumulate, in spite of my ability to read being as crippled by "the current events" as my ability to write. So, in order to return to the spirit of this exercise more quickly, I'm going to give all of those books a few sentences in response. This will probably be pretty uninteresting to read, but its necessary to soothe my completion neurosis.


# The Storyteller, Walter Benjamin

This collection gathers Benjamin's attempts at fiction, many of which remain incomplete. I found it fascinating, likely due to my freestanding interest in his life and work. For those who share such an interest, the book is a necessary read. His fables in particular seem to me to shed new light on the messianic non-teleology that he occasionally gestures towards elsewhere. For others, my recommendation is weaker; most of these are interesting fragments, drafts, or miscellany that do not rise above those categories. If you do pick it up, however, I doubt you'll be disappointed, and might even find (as I did) real glimpses of literary fire.

# Aye, and Gomorrah, Samuel Delaney

Amazing collection of SF/F stories, including the title story, a case study in new forms of sexual desire emerging from the features of a future society, and "Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones," about a criminal who uses the Joycean initians HCE for all his pseudonyms. They're all really good.

# Efuru, Flora Nwapa

A subtle critique of both the Eurocentric feminist perspective that consigns the gender practices of all other cultures to the dustbin of history and the traditionalist male Nigerian authors with whom she was contemporaneous, who at times uncritically affirmed those practices. Really fascinating use of dialogue, lots of time dedicated to "gossip" and "chatter."

# Alexis, Marguerite Yourcenar

Fun gay novella. First novel of a brilliant author still figuring some things out.

# The Cannibal, John Hawkes

I liked this quite a bit but now remember little about it. Perhaps because reading it feels uncannily like a moderate dose of a deliriant.

# Confessions of an English Opium Eater, Thomas de Quincey

Not much I can add here in a short space. If you know me, you'll know I'm a sucker for flowery prose about drug use. If that also describes you, then read this book.

# Elective Affinities, Goethe

Again, I don't know if I can add much here. Of course, the well-known formal structure of the novel provides plenty material for interpretation, but even setting that aside this is an gripping novel of manners.

# Religio Medici and Urne-Burial

Much like the de Quincey, this is right up my alley and was read here for the second or third time. Browne embodies a diversity of thought that seems particular to his time, escaping both the narrow tracks of specialization that would characterize scholarship not too long after his death and the bold (and ultimately doomed) claims to universality made by many that preceded him. There is no object which he considers excluded from his contemplation, yet he clearly feels no need to address topics which do not interest him. All this, of course, is done in one of the most beautifully ornate styles in English.

# Walter Benjamin Selected Writings vol. 1

Went through this for research. Benjamin is very good. All four volumes are worth reading in full.

# Walter Benjamin Selected Writings vol. 2 pt. 1

Ditto.

# Walter Benjamin Selected Writings vol. 2 pt. 2

Ditto.

# Walter Benjamin Selected Writings vol. 3

This is probably the worst of them.

# Walter Benjamin Selected Writings vol. 4

This is the best one, if you had to choose.

# Nietzsche and Metaphor, Sarah Kofman

In my limited experience, the most convincing of the French readings of Nietzsche. Kofman refuses the temptation to defang his more shocking conclusions, while simultaneously noting the degree to which these conclusions are complicated and qualified by the instabilities which Nietzsche (quite deliberately) inserts into the authorial voice.

# Blake's Apocalypse, Harold Bloom

Bloom is, for all his faults, a very good writer when he is on form, and this is a useful analysis, if at times a bit too indebted to Frye. He is at his best when closely reading passages and pointing out some subtle features on the levels of line and passage. Bloom brings the most light to The Four Zoas, but has little interesting to say about Jerusalem and nothing at all about the portions of Blake's work other than the "bare text." (He refuses to comment on the illustrations or the general method of illuminated printing, which Blake considered absolutely central to his work.) At times, he focuses on the "sexual" components of the Blakean mythos to the exclusion of its other valences. Still, this is a very readable and relatively short overview that could be of use to a reader trying to get a grip on the later Blake.

# Metaphysics of the Profane, Eric Jacobson

A book on "the political theology of Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem." I read this very quickly for research, so I cannot remember it in too much detail without digging up my notes, but I recall that I felt it failed to engage deeply with the later Benjamin, and is mostly useful for explaining some of the more obscure works in his early oeuvre.

# Eclipse, John Banville

Banville is a master of style, and Eclipse has to be one of the best showcases of his talent. The plot is not exactly "gripping," but I get the sense that he had no intention of making it so. The book floats along, punctuated by events that seem over as soon as we are aware of them. Eclipse is the first in a "trilogy," loosely defined, dealing with an actor in the twilight of his career and his estranged daughter, a precocious researcher with a mental disorder of unclear origin and effects. In my view, it is the weakest of the three (which will all be addressed here), but the combined effect is worth reading them in order.

# Shroud, John Banville

The next book in the aforementioned trilogy. Subtly metafictional without being annoying, although he can be a bit self-indulgent at times. I'm willing to forgive that in a book with this many great passages.

# Why Liberalism Failed, Patrick Deneen

This book sucks, Deneen is a hack, and you should not waste your time reading it.

# Walter Benjamin, Religion, and Aesthetics, S. Brent Plate

I do not remember too much about this, as it was read for the same purposes as the aforementioned book on Benjamin. Some thought-provoking passages, including a funny one about Seinfeld, but it did not make an intense impression.

# Homo Sacer, Giorgio Agamben

I read this, along with the many other Agamben books coming up, for a seminar. I will probably write something longer about Agamben at some point, but I'll just note that (like many of his books) this consists of some interesting philosophical history coupled with some rather wild and very vague conclusions about "the paradigm of Western sovereignty" and "the Aristotelian foundations of Western political ontology."

# Millenarianism and Messianism in Early Modern European Culture. Volume I: Jewish Messianism in the Early Modern World, eds. M. Goldish and R. Popkin

This is a collection of essays that's fairly well described by the title. Very interesting, need to get around to reading the second volume. One of the points that I remember most clearly is the way in which "Messianism" became a label applied to both heterodox Jews *and* heterodox Christians, eventually marking out a sort of theological "no-man's-land." 

# Blake: Prophet Against Empire, David V. Erdman

Erdman assembles a mountain of evidence that Blake was writing very specifically about political issues which concerned him. An incredibly useful reference text, and a vital resource for anyone writing about Blake, but as a freestanding interpretation I think Erdman's dogged focus on matching passages and figures directly to political events and characters ends up flattening much of the complexity, ambiguity, and multivalency which makes Blake's late works so powerful.

# Enlightenment's Wake, John Gray

Gray is a very smart and erudite man who, because he lacks a framework robust enough to make sense of it, is reduced to attributing the very real signs of "decay" which he identifies to the end-stage consequences of a loosely-defined "Enlightenment mindset." Much more interesting than, say, the Deneen book mentioned above, but still more an object of curiousity than a vehicle of genuine insight.

# The End of the Road, John Barth

Barth's second novel, before he "went postmodern." Starts as a cruel comedy with an unlikeable protagonist, ends in horror. A quick and worthwhile read.

# Dialectics of Seeing, Susan Buck-Morss

This is far and away the best secondary work on Benjamin that I have ever read. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in his thought.

# Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

Yeah, it's really good, I'm going back through Joyce this year.

# The Passions and the Interests, Albert Hirschman

This is an illuminating intellectual history of the shifts that took place prior to capitalism's full emergence, which I think (indirectly) sheds light on the emergence of the modern subject.

# Persian Letters, Montesquieu

The book is divided into two parts, the letters describing life in Paris (which form a hilarious and biting satire) and the story of the harem intrique back in Persia. I found the latter pretty boring, to be honest, but the former makes the whole book worth it.

# Remnants of Auschwitz, Giorgio Agamben

Probably the worst of the books of his that I read over the past few months. Do not recommend.

# The Once and Future Liberal, Mark Lilla

Lilla has a deeply impoverished picture of political possibility coupled with a child's theory of change. Only worth reading as symptomatic of the pathetic state of the liberal intelligentsia in the US. Remember, this dude thinks he's the heir to Trilling. One has to laugh.

# A Thousand Small Sanities, Adam Gopnik

Gopnik is Lilla without any of the unearned seriousness, yet somehow just as smug. Ditto the above assessment.

# State of Exception, Giorgio Agamben

An interesting little book, marred by the incoherent conclusion and a series of brutal misreadings of Schmitt and Benjamin.

# In the Shadow of Justice, Katrina Forrester

A competent history of the Rawlsian impact on political philosophy. It shows very effectively how certain features of this philosophy caused it to become isolated from the actual world of politics, but in doing so makes me wonder why I should care about political philosophy at all. In a sense, so effective that it removes its own raison d'etre.

# The Lost History of Liberalism, Helena Rosenblatt

A "word history" of liberalism that attempts to recenter the French liberal tradition and give some idea of the actual way that the word "liberal" was used in the years before "liberalism" was a recognized political ideology. Quite effective at this, I think, but in presenting the uses of the word so meticulously it leaves me wanting a bit more analysis of the intellectual and social conditions surrounding these uses.

# The News from Paraguay, Lily Tuck

Fun historical fiction that does some wonderful things with an anecdotal narrative structure, until the end where everybody dies and it gets very sad.

# Origin of the German Trauerspiel, Walter Benjamin

Benjamin's failed habilitation thesis is sometimes unfairly dismissed by those interested in his later work for being too "metaphysical" or too concerned with a now-irrelevant set of writers. I think Buck-Morss does a good job showing the connection between his critique of the Trauerspiel-writers and his own method, and would recommend reading this with her interpretation in mind.

# The Kingdom and the Glory, Giorgio Agamben

A monster of a book. If you like Agamben, check it out. If you don't, you'll want to die by the end.

# Inventing the Individual, Larry Siedentop

Siedentop attempts to relate the entire history of the West to show how liberalism was already present in putative form in the Pauline corpus. His attempt is stymied by his poor understanding of most of the topics he addresses. He also makes the strange choice of hanging his argument aggressively on a few large surveys; for instance, the only author cited in the first few chapters, and his only resource for anything pertaining to antiquity, is Fustel de Coulanges. A chapter or so later, he has switched to Guizot. This means that he unwittingly repeats some of their very controversial conclusions as if they are obvious fact. 

# Opus Dei, Giorgio Agamben

I don't want to write any more about Agamben, sorry.

# The Continuing City, Morton D. Paley

Fantastic guide to Blake's Jerusalem. The go-to book for anyone who wants to tackle it, I think.

# Ancient Light, John Banville

The last of the aforementioned trilogy. This one returns to the father in the central pair, as he recalls his own youthful affair with a married woman. (The book's first sentence: "Billy Gray was my best friend and I fell in love with his mother.") At the same time, the only book that comes close to Proust in addressing the experience of memory.

# Liberal Beginnings, Ira Katznelson and Andreas Kalyvas

The authors argue that liberalism, rather than being opposed to republicanism, emerged from the attempt to adapt the republican ideal to the modern context. I am not familiar enough with the surrounding literature to evaluate their contribution on those terms, but as a book taken alone I found it quite convincing.

# The Use of Bodies, Giorgio Agamben

...

# The Blind Owl, Sadegh Hedayat

To use the cliche that constantly attaches itself to this book, it reads like a nightmare. Hedayat uses a spartan palette of images and situations, rearranging them again and again. The effect is claustrophobic, but it is the claustrophobia of an empty room, filled with smoke.

# The Great Fear of 1789, Georges Lefebvre

Traces the 1789 panic about gangs of brigands in the countryside of France, which gripped the nation despite having no basis in reality. Wonderful account of the conditions which give rise to certain phenomena in public discourse.

# Autobiography of a Corpse, Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky

Amazing book, like nothing else I've ever read. Kafka on uppers and a diet of beets. Gogol with Chesterton's sense of humor. Neither of those descriptions is good at all, but it should get you in the neighborhood.

# From Rousseau to Lenin, Lucio Colletti

Found the first two essays, Marxism as Sociology and the essay on Bernstein and the Second International, both quite helpful. The former gives a good response to some accusations turned against vulgar economism, and the second seems to me a precise and accurate critique of social democrat foolishness on solid theoretical ground. The remaining essays were also interesting, but did not make as much of an impression.

# Notes on Conceptualisms, Vanessa Place and Robert Fitterman

A fun exercise and a quick read if you're in the mood for some conceptual poetic cleverness.

# Value -- The Representation of Labor in Capitalism, ed. Diane Elson

Hasn't made me into a VFT yet, but I'm getting there.

# Redemption and Utopia, Michael Lowy

A great history of Jewish libertarian thought in Mitteleuropa, which provided some very helpful context for a set of thinkers in whom I am already interested. 

# Wittgenstein and Religion, DZ Phillips

A collection of attempts to apply Wittgenstein's insights to the philosophy of religion. Many of the arguments within seem entirely convincing to me, and he does a good job of combatting the vulgarization that would take Wittgenstein to be opposing any possibility of religious critique or interreligious exchange. However, as I often find with Wittgensteinian philosophy of religion, I wish that more of an attempt was made to find the religious aspects of Wittgenstein's own work, and less time spent justifying the philosophical profession.

# The Lime Twig, John Hawkes

I read this on a meandering walk to and through a large nearby park, looking up occasionally to take in the beautiful surroundings before being absorbed again in the book. When I finished, I looked around and had the unsettling realization that I had become completely lost. The experience of reading the novel itself was quite similar.

# The Confusions of Young Torless, Robert Musil

I might write a longer post about this, because I think I have more to say, but Musil successfully avoids many of the Bildungsromanisch pitfalls, even when you think he has just fallen into them. There is something to be said here about the parallels between searching for erotic satisfaction and searching for philosophical satisfaction, but I don't have it quite in view yet. The novel could be particularly useful for those trying to figure out if they like Musil enough to tackle The Man Without Qualities.

# Covering Islam, Edward Said

Written in response to the Iran hostage crisis, Said tears apart the image of Islam constructed by the American media. Much of the book reads as intensely prescient of the 00s media landscape. He's a delightful writer, this is worth a read.

And that's it! Hope to have more substance for you in the future.
